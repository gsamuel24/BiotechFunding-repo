Biotech Funding Amount Predictions Relative to Therapeutic Area, Indication, Technology Type, and Phase of Development

## Brief Background
In the world of executive recruitment, knowing the factors that influence which companies get funding and how much, is incredibly valuable. Many biotech companies rely entirely on investor funding for a decade or more as they move through the drug development process. Only a small percentage of drug candidates make it to FDA approval, so the industry can be extremely volatile. Investor funding plays a crucial role in the success of any biotech, and knowing which companies have strong financial backing shows their ability to grow and hire new employees. For executive search firms, understanding where investors are focusing (therapeutic areas, indications, technologies, or stages of development) can help target more stable clients. It also supports long-term relationship building and keeps the firm ahead of market shifts. If the model reveals trends, like a rise in gene therapy investment that later shifts to cell therapy, the firm can adjust faster than competitors and show up with real-time market knowledge.

## Question
Do factors such as therapeutic area, indication, technology type, or phase of development influence the amount of funding a company will receive?

## Hypothesis & Predictions
**Hypothesis:**  
Historical funding data can be used to predict the amount of funding a biotech company will receive because it tells us about the patterns of how funding has been allocated historically relative to therapeutic area, indication, technology type, and stage of development. 

**Predictions:**  
Biotech companies developing treatments in high-interest therapeutic areas, indications, and technology types, and who are in later stages of development will receive higher funding amounts.
